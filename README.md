# Practice-Python

This repository contains a collection of simple Python projects designed for beginners to learn and practice fundamental programming concepts.  Each project focuses on specific aspects of Python, including:

* **Basic Input/Output:** Handling user input and displaying output.
* **Variables and Data Types:** Working with numbers, strings, and other data types.
* **Control Flow:** Using conditional statements (if-else), loops (for, while), and match-case (Python 3.10+).
* **Functions:** Defining and using functions to organize code.
* **Data Structures:** Basic use of lists and potentially dictionaries.
* **Modules and Libraries:**  Introduction to using external modules like `random`, `os`, and potentially `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`.
